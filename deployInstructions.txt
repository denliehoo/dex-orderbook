1. Find a node that we connect to (e.g. Speedy Nodes which is free on Moralis) https://admin.moralis.io/speedyNodes
2. Get the node URL e.g. (https://speedy-nodes-nyc.moralis.io/6a8709ed50ad0de3888dfb79/eth/ropsten)
3. Go to truffle-config.js file (refer to that file for more details)
4. We will need HDWalletProvider (npm install @truffle/hdwallet-provider) which is our wallet and mnemonic which is our seedphrase.
5. Under network:{...} we also need to input that network. in this case it will be ropsten. 
6. We also need to create a secret.json file in our root level.  This will be our secret key and we must ensure to add it to .gitignore.
This is what should be in secret.json
    {
        "secret": "....."
    }
7. We need a mnemonic, so we can generate one using "npx mnemonics" in the terminal. Copy the seed phrase in the secret.json file 
8. connect to ropsten network and get account address:
// allows us to connect to the ropsten
truffle console --network ropsten
//shows the accounts in the wallet
await web3.eth.getAccounts()
//check the balance of the first account (in this case it is 0x27fab0178B029653C520C12CE5e14d401a80C7a9)   => should return 0
// we will have 0 eth, hence, we will need to get ETH (can get it from a faucet)
await web3.eth.getBalance("0x27fab0178B029653C520C12CE5e14d401a80C7a9")
9. Get test ropsten eth from a faucet (copy paste the address into the faucet) [or send the network asset to your account]
10. go back to the terminal (should still be conencted to ropsten) and deploy. 
// allows us to connect to the ropsten if not done
truffle console --network ropsten
// check balance; should now not be 0
await web3.eth.getBalance("0x27fab0178B029653C520C12CE5e14d401a80C7a9")
// migrate the contract before deploying (need to do migrate --reset if we migrated before)
// (ensure also in ropsten)i.e. console should be truffle(ropsten)>
// this will take significantly longer because miners need to mine blocks first. 
migrate 

11. Once that is done, we can check whether the contract was deployed. Copy the contrac address (in the terminal)
(in this case it is 0x2Cb24424B71CaBc08F12985AE07e100580eFeBe4) then go to ropsten explorer (https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)
and copy paste the contract 

--> dex contract: 0x2Cb24424B71CaBc08F12985AE07e100580eFeBe4
token contract: 0x9D3f71eFDe8FDCe883F218287Cf3ed586B0D7F76
